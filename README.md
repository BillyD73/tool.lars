# LARS

The Liberty Asset Repository Service implements a repository for
Liberty features that you can deploy locally. You can host features
you have developed and features retrieved from the Websphere Liberty
Repository, and then use your Liberty server's installUtility command
to install the hosted features into your server.

## Documentation

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/WASdev/tool.lars/wiki) for documentation on how to build, install and use LARS.
